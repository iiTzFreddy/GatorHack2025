            A tornado flew around my room before you came
            Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in
            Southern California, much like Arizona
            My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they pour when
            I'm thinkin' 'bout you, ooh, no, no, no
            I've been thinkin' 'bout you, you know, know, know
            I've been thinkin' 'bout you, do you think about me still?
            Do ya, do ya?
            Or do you not think so far ahead?
            'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, ooh
            Or do you not think so far ahead?
            'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, ooh
            No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
            Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
            Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
            That's why I kissed you
            Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though
            I'm lying down
            I'm thinkin' 'bout you, ooh, no, no, no
            I've been thinkin' 'bout you, you know, know, know
            I've been thinkin' 'bout you, do you think about me still?
            Do ya, do ya?
            Or do you not think so far ahead?
            'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, ooh
            Or do you not think so far ahead?
            'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, ooh
            Yes, of course, I remember, how could I forget (how could I forget)
            How you feel? (How you feel?)
            You know you were my first time, a new feel
            It won't ever get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
            We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white
            Or do you not think so far ahead?
            'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, ooh
            Or do you not think so far ahead?
            'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, ooh
